            ## Issue Reference

            In order to be considered for merging, the pull request description must refer to a
            specific issue number. This is described in our
            [Contributing Guide](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/).

            This check is looking for a phrase similar to: "Fixes #XYZ" or "Resolves #XYZ" where XYZ is the issue
            number that this PR is meant to address.

            ## Protected Branch

            In order to be considered for merging, the pull request changes must
            not be implemented on the "%branch%" branch. This is described in our
            [Contributing Guide](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/).
            We would suggest that you close this PR and implement your changes as
            described in our Contributing Guide and open a new pull request.
